## Values

**Empathy**: The crucial value for a technical writer, empathy let's us see through others' eyes.

**Direct communication**: This generally falls under "Honesty", but is more specific. I never want to be a jerk, but I want to hear it how it is, and I want to tell you the truth as best I can.

This bears saying, because sometimes people will attach their ego to their work. Editing is a core part of technical writing, and a good editor is somewhere between a surgeon and a butcher with words.

All the work I do is in the interest of making the best explanations I can for the readers.

## Personality

- I like humor at work. I grew out of class clownism, but that's no reason not to make a joke when it's there to be made.
- I like to think things out. I think out loud a lot. I work remotely, but quick video meetings are a great way to get that creative coworking going when needed.
- I may not be the best at self-reflection. This is a note-to-self to improve this section later.

## Receiving Feedback & Recognition

I don't take praise well. If I did a good job, I'm happy about it. It's its own reward and all that. Please don't make a big deal about it.

Now constructive criticism, that I can handle. See [Values](#values) above. I am not my words, my ego isn't tied to it. My ego is tied to helping make the best documentation **we** can make.i

This applies to personal feedback as well. I want to be a good coworker to you, but I recognize that I probably am not "out of the box" ready. I can be "a bit much", and I recognize that. Don't be afraid to DM me if you need to get something off your chest.

I communicate strangely over text. The way I mean things isn't always the way the wait it's received. I'm working on it, but please give me the benefit of the doubt, or ask me to clarify.

## Work Patterns

I'm in the American Central time zone, and I usually start work somewhere between 8 and 10 AM, working through to 4 to 6 PM. For meetings and other team activities, 10-4 is the safe zone.

I'm used to working as a team, but alone. That is to say, I do my part of a project, and hand it back for review. If adjustments are needed, pass it back and I'll take another pass. Sometimes a group session is good to help get over a particular hurdle, and sometimes it's just fun to work with someone, even virtually. But it's not the norm.

## Communication Preferences

I answer all Slack messages. I may not always have the answer you want, but I don't leave people hanging, as it's a personal peeve of mine to be left on unread.

If we're working on a project, please use whatever project management tool we're using for updates. Rest assured, whatever tool we're using I've got notifications for it.

## How To Know I've Gone To The Dark Side

### Warning Signs

I'm usually pretty vocal. About everything. All the time. Annoyingly so. If I go mute, it's probably because I don't feel comfortable saying what I think needs to be said.


## Me Being Me

As mentioned above, I try to make jokes when I can. I want work to be light-hearted. But when I'm not joking, I'm as direct as I can be, sometimes to the detriment of the point I'm trying to make. 

## Pet Peeves

_I don't expect this list to change your actionsâ€”but it might help you better understand and empathize with my
reactions._

I'd much prefer an "I don't know", or an "I can't look at this right now" to a wrong answer, or to being ignored. Please let me know that I'm not just shouting into the void.


## Ask Me About

Music! Or better yet, tell me about some music.
